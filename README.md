RPI Microprocessor Systems Repository for STM32F769I-Discovery Kit: Linux Build Scripts and Backend Folder

This repository contains the Linux build scripts themselves, as well as the Linux Backend folder. In order to open the archive, you'll need a file compression utility like 7-zip. Just opening the .001 file with the utility when all the archive's parts are in one folder will then open the whole archive. The split has been done to keep file sizes manageable.
